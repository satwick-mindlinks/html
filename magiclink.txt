Multi Agent Requirements:
As part of the user management process in tax document collection portal, there is a need to
provide options for the user to either request for 1. Forgot Password OR 2. Generate a magic link
from the Login page.

1.Forgot Password:
Related to Forgot password, it is standard process of user enters the username, after
validating for the correct account, forgot password link should be sent to the register email
On click of forgot password, user is allowed to set the new password as per the password
security. After the forgot password flow is completed, user is taken to the login page where
user can login with the new password

2.Magic link Generation
To facilitate the quick login to the registered users who usually don’t remember password,
we need to provide Magic link option. On click of the magic link, user are asked for their
registered username, after user submits the username, it is validated and magic link is sent
to the user registered email for the valid users only.
On click of the magic link, system validated the link and auto login if the link is valid and not
expired. Note that, magic link will have time duration within which user should login and can
be used only once.

Expectation:
1. Code Generator to generate the UI, business logic, database interactions which means end
to
End implementation of the above 2 scenarios
2. It should follow tax document collection technology stack
3. Demo should be planned to showcase the complete end to end working code which can be
adopted in the tax portal project

Inputs to Code Generator:
1. Requirement document
2. Database Schema – Get it from tax portal team
Output from code generator:
1. UI components which should be tested from application
2. Python code with business logic
3. Python code with database interactions

Any improvements can be adopted for better output delivery
